## <p align='center'>Welcome to the BitBar Appium Server Side Sample Script!</p>

This script runs as a Server-Side Appium Android script to BitBar.

We will use the Wikipedia app for testing. This is an extremely simple script that launches the Wikipedia app, searches for 'SmartBear' and verfies the description of the first search result.

Happy Testing!
